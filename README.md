# Autonomous Coding Workflow
## TLDR ðŸ”´
```
git clone https://github.com/hem9984/Azlon-demo.git
cd Azlon-demo
```
```
echo "OPENAI_KEY=sk-..." > .env
```
```
docker compose up
```
* Frontend UI: http://localhost:8080/
* Restack UI: http://localhost:5233/

### Usage in Frontend UI
1. Enter your user_prompt and test_conditions.
2. Click "Run Workflow".
3. Wait for your project code to complete!
* ðŸ¤– It will recursively generate code, run the code, and fix the code if needed until it deems that your test case(s) are fulfilled.
-------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview
This project sets up an autonomous coding workflow using Restack, OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, Docker-in-Docker for building and running Docker images, and a frontend React UI to interact with the system. Users can provide a user_prompt and test_conditions to generate code automatically, run it in a containerized environment, and validate the results. Users can also toggle an "advanced mode" to edit system prompts directly.

## Prerequisites
### Docker & Docker Compose:
* Ensure Docker (>= 20.10) and Docker Compose (>= 1.29) are installed.
* Install Docker | Install Docker Compose

### OpenAI API Key:
* Sign up for OpenAI and get an API key: OpenAI API Keys

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/hem9984/Azlon-demo.git
cd Azlon-demo
```

2. Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project root. Add your OpenAI key:
bash
```
echo "OPENAI_KEY=sk-..." > .env
```
* Ensure this .env file contains OPENAI_KEY.

## Build & Run the Full Stack with Docker Compose: 

### The docker-compose.yml orchestrates:

* restack-engine
* docker-dind (Docker-in-Docker)
* backend (FastAPI + Restack)
* frontend (React UI)

3. Start them all with one command:
bash
```
docker compose up
```
### This will:

* Run Restack engine on http://localhost:5233 (and other ports as specified).
* Run the backend on http://localhost:8000
* Run the frontend on http://localhost:3000
* Check the docker-compose.yml and frontend/Dockerfile for the final frontend port and mode.

# SETUP DONE! YOU ARE READY TO USE ðŸŽŠ

## Accessing the Application (open these two links in web browser windows):

#### Restack UI: http://localhost:5233/
The Restack UI will show you running workflows and other details.

#### Frontend UI: http://localhost:3000/
The React UI lets you enter your user_prompt and test_conditions. If you enable advanced mode in the GUI, you can edit system prompts as well.



# Usage
1. Open the frontend URL (http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
   a. Also open http://localhost:5233/ if you want to view the process in real-time!
2.  Enter your user_prompt and test_conditions.
   a. Toggle advanced mode if you want to modify the system prompts.
3. Click "Run Workflow".

#### The application will:
* Use your prompts to generate code and a Docker environment.
* Build and run the generated code in a container.
* Validate the output against test_conditions.
* Display the results in the frontend UI.
